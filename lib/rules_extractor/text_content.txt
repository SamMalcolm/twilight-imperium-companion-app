Then, each player places their decks in their play area along with their command sheet and plastic units.Then, each player places their leader sheet in their play area. They then place their agent, commander, and hero leader cards as well as their mech unit card in the corresponding slots. All leaders are placed showing the side that has the slot icon in the upper-right corner.STEP 5—DISTRIBUTE STARTING PLANET CARDS: Each player takes the planet cards that correspond to the planets in their home system and places those cards faceup in their play area.STEP 6—CREATE GAME BOARD: Place the Mecatol Rex system tile in the center of the common play area—this is the center of the galaxy. The galaxy will consist of either three or four rings around Mecatol Rex. Each player’s home systems will be in a set position in the third ring. Use the “Game Board Setup” diagram to estimate where players’ home systems will be placed based on each player’s position around the game area.Next, if the desired game board setup uses hyperlane tiles, gather the following hyperlane tiles and place them exactly as shown in corresponding diagram on page 6:•FIVE-PLAYER (HYPERLANES): 83A, 84A, 85A, 86A, 87A, and 88A.•SEVEN-PLAYER: 83A, 84A, 85A, 86A, 87A, and 88A.•SEVEN-PLAYER (ALTERNATE): 83B, 84B, 85B, 86B, 88B, and 90B.•EIGHT-PLAYER (ALTERNATE): 83B, 85B, 87A, 88A, 89B, and 90B. Place the wormhole nexus in the common play area so the side that shows only the gamma wormhole is faceup. Place the 3 gamma wormhole tokens next to the wormhole nexus. Then, create the rest of game board following these steps:i.SEPARATE SYSTEMS: Separate the system tiles into two piles using the color on the back of each tile: one pile of blue-backed system tiles and one pile of red-backed system tiles. Green-backed system tiles are home systems and are not separated into piles in this way.ii.DEAL SYSTEM TILES: Shuffle each pile of system tiles facedown. Then, deal facedown system tiles to each player according to player count and desired game board setup:•THREE-PLAYER:Six blue and two red tiles are dealt to each player.•FOUR-PLAYER: Five blue and three red tiles are dealt to each player.USING THIS REFERENCEThis document is the definitive source for all Twilight ImperiumFourth Edition: Prophecy of Kings rules. The Living Rules Reference will occasionally be updated with additions, clarifications, errata, and an FAQ, changes to which are listed on page 3. Additionally, the related topics of each entry can be clicked to navigate to the associated section.The glossary provides players with detailed rules and clarifications listed in alphabetical order by topic. Players are encouraged to use the glossary’s digital bookmarks as well as the index on page 38to find specific topics within the glossary.COMPLETE SETUPThis section describes how to set up a game using all of the advanced rules. Note that some of these steps vary slightly from the “First-Game Setup” rules.STEP 1—DETERMINE SPEAKER: Randomly determine one player to gain the speaker token; that player is the speaker.STEP 2—CHOOSE FACTIONS: Each player chooses one faction sheet; this is their faction for the game. Each player places their faction sheet in their play area.STEP 3—GATHER FACTION COMPONENTS: Each player takes the following components that have their faction’s icon:•1 home system tile•17 control tokens•16 command tokens•1 faction promissory note•2 faction technology cards•3 leader cards•1 mech unit card•additional faction- specific components*Each player places each of their faction components near their faction sheet. Players return all unused faction components to the game box.*NOTE: Only the Naalu Collective, the Nekro Virus, the Ghosts of Creuss, the Embers of Muaat, the Vuil’raith Cabal, the Nomad, the Empyrean, and the Titans of Ul have additional faction-specific components.STEP 4—CHOOSE COLOR: Each player chooses one color and takes the following components that correspond to that color. •63 plastic units•1 command sheet•1 leader sheet•33 technology cards•5 promissory notes5NOTE: During a five-player game that does not use hyperlanes, three players will have a slight disadvantage because of their home systems’ starting positions on the game board. After creating the game board, those players receive trade goods according to their positions. Use the diagram on page 6 to determine how many trade goods each of those players receives.STEP 7—PLACE GAME BOARD TOKENS: Place the custodians token in the center of the game board on Mecatol Rex.Then, place one frontier token on each system that has no planets. Return the remaining frontier tokens to the game box. Place all attachment tokens near the game board.STEP 8—SHUFFLE COMMON DECKS: Shuffle the action card, agenda, stage I objective, stage II objective, and secret objective decks separately and place them in the common play area.Shuffle the relic deck and each exploration deck separately and place them in the common play area.STEP 9—CREATE SUPPLY: Gather and create separate piles in the common play area for trade good tokens, fighter tokens, and infantry tokens.Place the planet cards and legendary planet ability cards near the game board.STEP 10—GATHER STRATEGY CARDS: Place each of the eight strategy cards faceup in the common play area within reach of the speaker.STEP 11—GATHER STARTING COMPONENTS: Each player gains the starting technologies and starting units listed on the back of their faction sheet. Each player places the technology cards faceup near their faction sheet and the starting units in their home system. Each player places three command tokens in their tactic pool, three command tokens in their fleet pool, and two command tokens in their strategy pool.STEP 12—PREPARE OBJECTIVES: Prepare objectives as follows:i.Each player draws two secret objectives and chooses one to keep. Shuffle the unchosen secret objectives back into the secret objective deck without revealing them.ii.Place the victory point track near the game board. As a group, players decide whether to play with the 10- or 14-space side of the victory point track faceup. Each player places one of their control tokens on the “0” space of the track.iii.The speaker deals five facedown stage I objectives and places them in a row above the victory point track. Then, the speaker deals five facedown stage II objectives and places them in a row below the victory point track.iv.The speaker reveals the first two stage I objectives.•FIVE-PLAYER (NO HYPERLANES):Four blue and two red tiles are dealt to each player.•FIVE-PLAYER (HYPERLANES):Three blue and two red tiles are dealt to each player.•SIX-PLAYER:Three blue and two red tiles are dealt to each player.•SIX-PLAYER (LARGE GALAXY):Six blue and three red tiles are dealt to each player.•SEVEN-PLAYER:Four blue and two red tiles are dealt to each player.•SEVEN-PLAYER (ALTERNATE):Three blue and two red tiles are dealt to each player.•EIGHT-PLAYER:Four blue and two red tiles are dealt to each player.•EIGHT-PLAYER (ALTERNATE):Three blue and two red tiles are dealt to each player.NOTE: For some player counts and game board setups, additional system tiles are required. Before placing system tiles for the following setups, the speaker draws additional system tiles and places them faceup in any space adjacent to Mecatol Rex:•FIVE-PLAYER (NO HYPERLANES):The speaker places one red tile.•SEVEN-PLAYER:The speaker places two red and three blue tiles.•EIGHT-PLAYER:The speaker places two red and two blue tiles.iii.PLACE SYSTEM TILES: First, players place their home systems in the approximate positions where they will connect to the galaxy. Then, starting with the speaker and proceeding clockwise, each player places one system tile faceup in the first ring around Mecatol Rex. After the last player has placed their first tile, they place a second tile. Then, the order of tile placement reverses and proceeds counterclockwise, until it reaches the speaker again, who places two tiles. Then, tile placement reverses again and proceeds clockwise. This process repeats until players have placed all of their tiles.Each ring around Mecatol Rex must be fully built before any tile can be placed in the next ring. Anomaly system tiles cannot be placed next to one another unless there is no other option. Additionally, system tiles that contain the same type of wormhole cannot be placed next to one another unless there is no other option. After placing all of the dealt system tiles, players attach their home systems to the rest of the galaxy.6GAME BOARD SETUPSSix-Player SetuPFour-Player SetuPthree-Player SetuPFive-Player SetuP+2+2+4Five-Player(hyPerlaneS)eight-PlayerSeven-PlayerMecatolrexhoMe SySteMhyPerlanering 1ring 2ring 3ring 4Six-Player(largegalaxy)eight-Player(alternate)Seven-Player(alternate)71.13TIMING1.14If the timing of an ability uses the word “before” or “after,” the ability’s effect occurs immediately before or after the described timing event, respectively.aFor example, if an ability is resolved “after a ship is destroyed,” the ability must be resolved as soon as the ship is destroyed and not later during that turn or round.1.15If the timing of an ability uses the word “when,” the ability’s effect occurs at the moment of the described timing event.aSuch an ability typically modifies or replaces the timing event in some way.1.16Effects that occur “when” an event happens take priority over effects that occur “after” an event happens.1.17If an ability uses the word “then,” a player must resolve the effect that occurs before the word “then” or they cannot resolve the effect that occurs after the word “then.”1.18Each ability can be resolved once for each occurrence of that ability’s timing event. For example, if an ability is resolved “At the start of combat,” it can be resolved at the start of each combat.1.19If there are multiple abilities that players wish to resolve at the same time during the action phase, each player takes a turn resolving an ability in initiative order, beginning with the active player. This process continues until each player has resolved each ability that they wish to resolve during that window.1.20If there are multiple abilities that players wish to resolve at the same time during the strategy or agenda phases, players take turns resolving abilities starting with the speaker and proceeding clockwise. This process continues until each player has resolved each ability that they wish to resolve during that window.1.21COMPONENT-SPECIFIC RULES1.22The opening paragraph of each ability found on an action card describes when a player can resolve that card’s ability.1.23The opening paragraph of most abilities found on promissory notes describes when a player can resolve that card’s ability.aSome promissory notes have abilities that trigger as soon as a player receives the card.1.24Abilities on agenda cards correspond to an outcome. Players resolve these abilities during the agenda phase after players vote for a particular outcome.1.25Each faction has faction abilities presented on its faction sheet. Each faction’s flagship has one or more unique abilities. Some abilities provide players with perpetual effects.GLOSSARYThis glossary provides players with detailed rules for Twilight Imperium: Fourth Edition and its Prophecy of Kings expansion,organized by topic. Players are encouraged to use the index on page 38 to find specific topics within the glossary.1ABILITIESCards and faction sheets each have abilities that players can resolve to trigger various game effects.1.1If information in this Rules Reference contradicts the Learn to Play booklet, the Rules Reference takes precedence.1.2If a card ability contradicts information in the Rules Reference, the card takes precedence. If both the card and the rules can be followed at the same time, they should be.1.3Each ability describes when and how a player can resolve it.aIf an ability with a specified duration is resolved, the effect of the ability remains through that duration, even if the component that caused the ability is removed.1.4If a card has multiple abilities, each ability is presented as its own paragraph.1.5If an ability contains the word “Action,” a player must use a component action during the action phase to resolve that ability.1.6If an ability uses the word “cannot,” that effect is absolute.aIf two abilities use the word “cannot,” a persistent ability takes precedence over a one-time ability and an enabling ability takes precedence over a cancel ability.1.7When a player resolves an ability, they must resolve the ability in its entirety. Any parts of the ability preceded by the word “may” are optional, and the player resolving the ability may choose not to resolve those parts.1.8Abilities on components that remain in play are mandatory unless those abilities use the word “may.”1.9If an ability has multiple effects separated by the word “and,” a player must resolve as many of the ability’s effects as possible. However, if the player cannot resolve all of its effects, that player is allowed to resolve as many as they can.1.10COSTS1.11Some abilities have a cost that is followed by an effect. The cost of an ability is separated from the effect by the word “to” or by a semicolon. A player cannot resolve the effect of such an ability if they cannot resolve that ability’s cost. 1.12Some examples of an ability’s cost include spending resources, spending trade goods, spending command tokens, exhausting cards, purging cards, and activating specific systems.82.6The first paragraph of each action card is presented in bold text and describes the timing of when that card’s ability can be resolved.aIf an action card contains the word “Action,” a player must use a component action during the action phase to resolve the ability. A player cannot resolve a component action if they cannot completely resolve its ability.bMultiple action cards with the same name cannot be played during a single timing window to affect the same units or game effect. Canceled cards are not treated as being played.2.7To play an action card, a player reads and resolves the card’s ability text, making any decisions as prompted by the card. Then, that player discards the card, placing it in the action discard pile.2.8If an action card is canceled, that card has no effect and is discarded.RELATED TOPICS:Abilities, Component Action, Politics, Status Phase3ACTION PHASEDuring the action phase, each player takes a turn in initiative order. During a player’s turn, they perform a single action. After each player has taken a turn, player turns begin again in initiative order. This process continues until all players have passed.3.1During a player’s turn, they may perform one of the following three types of actions: a strategic action, a tactical action, or a component action.3.2If a player cannot perform an action, they must pass.3.3After a player has passed, they have no further turns and cannot perform additional actions during that action phase.aDuring a turn that a player passes, they can resolve transactions and “at the start of your turn” abilities.bA player that has passed can still resolve the secondary ability of other players’ strategy cards.cIt is possible for a player to perform multiple, consecutive actions during an action phase if all other players have passed during that action phase.3.4A player cannot pass until they have performed the strategic action of their strategy card.aDuring a three-player or four-player game, a player cannot pass until they have exhausted both of their strategy cards.3.5After all players have passed, play proceeds to the status phase.RELATED TOPICS:Component Action, Game Round, Status Phase, Strategic Action, Tactical Action1.26Some units have unit abilities. These abilities are named and presented above a unit’s attributes on a player’s faction sheet or on a unit upgrade card. Each unit ability has unique rules for when a player can resolve that ability. The following abilities are unit abilities:•Anti-Fighter Barrage•Bombardment•Deploy•Planetary Shield•Production•Space Cannon•Sustain Damage1.27If a unit’s ability uses the phrase “this system” or “this planet,” the ability is referring to the system or planet that contains that unit.RELATED TOPICS:Action Cards, Leaders, Promissory Notes, Strategy Card, Technology2ACTION CARDSAction cards provide players with various abilities that they can resolve as described on the cards.2.1Each player draws one action card during each status phase.2.2Players can draw action cards by resolving the primary and secondary abilities of the “Politics” strategy card.2.3When a player draws an action card, they take the top card from the action card deck and add it to their hand of action cards.2.4Each player’s hand can have a maximum of seven action cards. If a player ever has more than seven action cards, that player must choose seven cards to keep and discard the rest.aA game effect can increase or decrease the number of cards a player’s hand can have.2.5A player’s action cards remain hidden from other players until those cards are played.97AGENDA CARDAgenda cards represent galactic laws and policies. During each agenda phase, players cast votes for specific outcomes on two agenda cards.7.1There are two types of agenda cards: laws and directives.7.2Laws can permanently change the rules of the game. 7.3When resolving a law, if a “For” outcome received the most votes, or if the law requires an election, the law’s ability becomes a permanent part of the game. Players resolve the outcome and place the agenda card either in the common play area or in a player’s play area, as dictated by the card.7.4If a law is in a player’s play area as opposed to the common play area, that player owns that law.7.5If a law is discarded from play, that law’s ability is no longer in effect. Place that card on the top of the agenda card discard pile.7.6If an “Against” outcome of a law received the most votes, players resolve the outcome and discard the agenda.7.7Directives provide one-time game effects. 7.8When resolving a directive, players resolve the outcome that received the most votes and discard the agenda card.RELATED TOPICS:Agenda Phase, Attach, Victory Points4ACTIVE PLAYERThe active player is the player taking a turn during the action phase.4.1During the action phase, the player who is first in initiative order is the first active player.4.2After the active player takes a turn, the next player in initiative order becomes the active player.4.3After the last player in initiative order takes a turn, the player who is first in initiative order becomes the active player again, and turns begin again in initiative order, ignoring any players who have already passed.RELATED TOPICS:Action Phase, Initiative Order5ACTIVE SYSTEMThe active system is the system that is activated during a tactical action.5.1When a player performs a tactical action, they activate a system by placing a command token from their tactic pool in that system. That system is the active system.5.2A player cannot activate a system that already contains one of their command tokens.5.3A player can activate a system that contains command tokens that match other players’ factions.5.4A system remains the active system for the duration of the tactical action during which it was activated.RELATED TOPICS: Movement, Tactical Action6ADJACENCYTwo system tiles are adjacent to each other if any of the tiles’ sides are touching each other.6.1A system that has a wormhole is treated as being adjacent to a system that has a matching wormhole.6.2A unit or planet is adjacent to all system tiles that are adjacent to the system tile that contains that unit or planet.aA system is not adjacent to itself.6.3A planet is treated as being adjacent to the system that contains that planet.6.4Systems that are connected by lines drawn across one or more hyperlane tiles are adjacent for all purposes.RELATED TOPICS: Hyperlanes, Movement, Neighbors, Wormhole Nexus, Wormholes10aWhen resolving these agendas, the “elected planet” is the planet that had the most votes cast for it.8.12When casting votes, a player must declare aloud the outcome for which their votes are being cast.8.13Trade goods cannot be spent to cast votes.8.14A player may choose to abstain by not casting any votes.8.15Some game effects allow a player to cast additional votes for an outcome. These votes cannot be cast for a different outcome than other votes cast by that player.8.16If a player cannot vote on an agenda because of a game effect, that player cannot cast votes for that agenda by exhausting planets or through any other game effect.8.17OUTCOMES8.18To resolve an outcome, the speaker follows the instructions on the agenda card.8.19If there is a tie for the outcome that received the most votes, or if no outcome receives any votes, the speaker decides which of the tied outcomes to resolve.aThe speaker’s decision is not a vote.8.20If an “Elect” or “For” outcome of a law was resolved, that card remains in play and permanently affects the game.8.21If a directive or an “Against” outcome of a law was resolved, that card is placed in the agenda discard pile.8.22Some game effects instruct a player to predict an outcome. To predict an outcome, a player declares aloud the outcome they think will receive the most votes. That player must make this prediction after the agenda is revealed but before any votes have been cast.aA predicted outcome must be a possible outcome of the revealed agenda.bAfter resolving the outcome of the agenda, any abilities that were dependent upon predicting the outcome are resolved.RELATED TOPICS:Custodians Token, Game Round, Influence9ANOMALIESAn anomaly is a system tile that has unique rules.9.1An anomaly is identified by a red border located on the tile’s corners.9.2There are four types of anomalies: asteroid fields, nebulae, supernovas, and gravity rifts.aSome anomalies contain planets; those systems are still anomalies.8AGENDA PHASEDuring the agenda phase, players can cast votes on agendas that can change the rules of the game.8.1Players skip the agenda phase during the early portion of each game. After the custodians token is removed from Mecatol Rex, the agenda phase is added to each game round. To resolve the agenda phase, players perform the following steps:8.2STEP 1—FIRST AGENDA: Players resolve the first agenda by following these steps in order:i.REVEAL AGENDA: The speaker draws one agenda card from the top of the agenda deck and reads it aloud to all players, including all of its possible outcomes.ii.VOTE: Each player, starting with the player to the left of the speaker and continuing clockwise, can cast votes for an outcome of the current agenda.iii.RESOLVE OUTCOME: Players tally each vote that was cast and resolve the outcome that received the most votes.8.3STEP 2—SECOND AGENDA: Players repeat the “First Agenda” step of this phase for a second agenda.8.4STEP 3—READY PLANETS: Each player readies each of their exhausted planets. Then, a new game round begins starting with the strategy phase.8.5VOTINGWhen voting during the agenda phase, a player can cast votes for a specific outcome of an agenda.8.6To cast votes, a player exhausts any number of their planets and chooses an outcome. The number of votes cast for that outcome is equal to the combined influence values of the planets that the player exhausts.aWhen a player exhausts a planet to cast votes, that player must cast the full amount of votes provided by that planet.8.7A player cannot cast votes for multiple outcomes of the same agenda. Each vote a player casts must be for the same outcome.8.8Some agendas have “For” and “Against” outcomes. When a player casts votes on such an agenda, that player must cast their votes either “For” or “Against.”8.9Some agendas instruct players to elect either a player or a planet. When a player casts votes for such an agenda, that player must cast their vote for an eligible player or planet as described on the agenda.8.10When electing a player, a player can cast votes for themselves. aWhen resolving these agendas, the “elected player” is the player for whom the most votes are cast.8.11When electing a planet, a player must cast votes for a planet that is controlled by a player.1111ASTEROID FIELDAn asteroid field is an anomaly that affects movement.11.1A ship cannot move through or into an asteroid field.RELATED TOPICS:Anomalies12ATTACHSome game effects instruct a player to attach a card to a planet card.

During the “Anti-Fighter Barrage” step of the first round of space combat, players perform the following steps:10.1STEP 1—Each player rolls dice for each of their units in the combat that has the “Anti-Fighter Barrage” ability; this is called an anti-fighter barrage roll. A hit is produced for each die roll that is equal to or greater than the unit’s anti-fighter barrage value.aA unit’s “Anti-Fighter Barrage” ability is presented along with a unit’s attributes on faction sheets and unit upgrade technology cards.bThe “Anti-Fighter Barrage” ability is displayed as “Anti-Fighter Barrage X (xY).” The X is the minimum value needed for a die to produce a hit, and Y is the number of dice rolled.cGame effects that reroll, modify, or otherwise affect combat rolls do not affect anti-fighter barrage rolls.dThis ability can still be used if no fighters are present; hits produced may be used to trigger specific abilities.10.2STEP 2:—Each player must choose and destroy one of their fighters in the active system for each hit their opponent’s anti-fighter barrage roll produced.aIf a player has to assign more hits than they have fighters in the active system, the excess hits have no effect.RELATED TOPICS:Destroyed, Space CombatGravity RiftNebulaAsteroid FieldSupernova12aA player can choose which of their excess units to remove.bGround forces on planets do not count against capacity.cA player’s fighters and ground forces do not count against capacity during combat.

During the “Bombardment” step, players perform the following steps:15.1STEP 1— The active player chooses which planet each of their units that has a “Bombardment” ability will bombard. Then, that player rolls dice for each of those units; this is called a bombardment roll. A hit is produced for each die roll that is equal to or greater than the unit’s “Bombardment” value.aA unit’s “Bombardment” ability is presented along with a unit’s attributes on faction sheets and unit upgrade technology cards.bThe “Bombardment” ability is displayed as “Bombardment X (xY).” The X is the minimum value needed for a die to produce a hit, and Y is the number of dice rolled. Not all “Bombardment” abilities have a (Y) value; a bombardment roll for such a unit consists of one die.cGame effects that reroll, modify, or otherwise affect combat rolls do not affect bombardment rolls.dMultiple planets in a system may be bombarded, but a player must declare which planet a unit is bombarding before making a bombardment roll.eThe L1Z1X’s “Harrow” ability does not affect the L1Z1X player’s own ground forces.fPlanets that contain a unit with the “Planetary Shield” ability cannot be bombarded.15.2STEP 2— The player who controls the planet that is being bombarded chooses and destroys one of their ground forces on that planet for each hit result the bombardment roll produced.aIf a player has to assign more hits than that player has ground forces, the excess hits have no effect.RELATED TOPICS:Invasion, Planetary Shield16CAPACITY (ATTRIBUTE)Capacity is an attribute of some units that is presented on faction sheets and unit upgrade technology cards.16.1A unit’s capacity value indicates the maximum combined number of fighters and ground forces that it can transport.16.2The combined capacity values of a player’s ships in a system determine the number of fighters and ground forces that player can have in that system’s space area.16.3If a player has more fighters and ground forces in the space area of a system than the total capacity of that player’s ships in that system, that player must remove the excess units.1320.2When a player gains a command token, they choose which of their three pools to place it in.20.3A player is limited by the amount of command tokens in their reinforcements.aIf a player would gain a command token but has none available in their reinforcements, that player cannot gain that command token.bIf a game effect would place a player’s command token from their reinforcements and none are available, that player must take a token from a pool on their command sheet, unless the token would be placed into a system that already contains one of their command tokens.20.4During the action phase, a player can perform a tactical action by spending a command token from their tactic pool; they place the command token in a system.20.5After a player performs a strategic action during the action phase, each other player can resolve the secondary ability of that strategy card by spending a command token from their strategy pool.aA player does not spend a command token to resolve the secondary ability of the “Leadership” strategy card.20.6If a game effect would place a player’s command token in a system where they already have one, they place the token in their reinforcements instead.

A player can remove any number of their units in this way; however, any units that are removed must be placed immediately. Abilities cannot force a player to remove and place a unit in this manner.bWhen producing a fighter or infantry unit, a player can use a fighter or infantry token, as appropriate, from the supply instead of a plastic piece. These tokens must be accompanied by at least one plastic piece of the same type; players can swap infantry and fighter tokens for plastic pieces at any time.23.5CARDS: When a deck is depleted, players shuffle the deck’s discard pile and place it facedown to create a new deck.RELATED TOPICS:Producing Units, Units24CONSTRUCTION (STRATEGY CARD)The “Construction” strategy card allows players to construct structures on planets they control. This card’s initiative value is “4.”24.1During the action phase, if the active player has the “Construction” strategy card, they can perform a strategic action to resolve that card’s primary ability.24.2To resolve the primary ability on the “Construction” strategy card, the active player may place either one PDS or one space dock on a planet they control. Then, that player may place an additional PDS on a planet they control.aThe structures can be placed on the same planet or different planets.bThe structures can be placed in any systems, regardless of whether the player has a command token in the system or not.21.5Players can trade commodities following the rules for transactions. When a player receives a commodity from another player, the player who received that token converts it into a trade good by placing it in the trade good area of their command sheet with the trade good side faceup.aThat token is no longer a commodity token; it is a trade good token.bA player can trade commodity tokens before resolving a game effect that allows them to replenish commodities.cIf a game effect instructs a player to convert a number of their own commodities to trade goods, those trade goods are not treated as being gained for the purpose of triggering other abilities.21.6Any game effect that instructs a player to give a commodity to another player causes that commodity to be converted into a trade good.21.7A player cannot spend commodities unless otherwise specified; a player can only trade them during a transaction.21.8Commodity tokens come in values of one and three.

However, other game effects also allow players to produce units.67.1Each unit that a player can produce has a cost value presented on its faction sheet or technology card. To produce a unit, a player must spend a number of resources equal to or greater than the cost value of the unit they are producing. aSpent resources must come from planets or trade goods that are controlled by the player who is producing the units.bAny resources spent in excess of a unit’s cost are lost.cIf a player is producing multiple units at a time, that player can add the cost of each unit they are producing to create a total cost before they spend any resources.67.2If the cost is accompanied by two icons—typically for fighters and infantry—a player produces two of that unit for that cost.aEach of the two units counts toward the total number of units a player can produce.2770PURGEPurge is a cost that permanently removes a component from the game. If an ability requires that its component is purged, that component can only be used once per game.70.1If an ability instructs a player to purge a component, that component is removed from the game and returned to the box.70.2Purged components cannot be used or otherwise returned to the game by any means.70.3When a player is intructed to purge a component, that component is purged even if its ability was only partially resolved.RELATED TOPICS:Abilities71READIEDCards have a readied state, which indicates that a player can exhaust or resolve the abilities on those cards.71.1A card that is readied is placed faceup in a player’s play area; a card that is exhausted is placed facedown in a player’s area.71.2A player can exhaust a readied planet card to spend resources or influence from that card’s planet.71.3A player can exhaust certain readied technology cards to resolve those cards’ abilities.aSuch a technology will specifically instruct a player to exhaust the card as part of the ability’s cost.71.4If a card is exhausted, a player cannot resolve that card’s abilities or spend resources or influence on that card until it is readied.71.5During a “Ready Cards” step, each player readies all of their exhausted cards by flipping them faceup.71.6When a player performs a strategic action, they exhaust their chosen strategy card.aThat card is later readied during the status phase.RELATED TOPICS:Abilities, Exhausted, Status Phase72REINFORCEMENTSA player’s reinforcements is that player’s personal supply of units and command tokens that are not on the game board or otherwise in use.72.1The components in a player’s reinforcements are limited.RELATED TOPICS:Command Tokens, Component Limitations, Unitsd“Production” value from Arborec space docks cannot be used to produce infantry, even if the Arborec player controls other units that have “Production” in the same system.68.2When a player produces ships by using “Production,” that player must place them in the active system.68.3When a player produces ground forces, that player must place those unit on planets that contain a unit that used its “Production” ability.68.4If a player uses the “Production” ability of a unit in a space area of a system to produce ground forces, those ground forces may either be placed on a planet the player controls in that system or in the space area of that system.RELATED TOPICS:Blockaded, Producing Units, Space Dock69PROMISSORY NOTESEach player begins the game with one unique and five generic promissory note cards that can be given to other players.69.1Each promissory note contains timing text and ability text.

Then, each unit using this ability is placed on its side to indicate that it is damaged.87.2A damaged unit does not have reduced capabilities and is functionally the same as an undamaged unit, except that it cannot use the “Sustain Damage” ability.87.3A damaged unit cannot use the “Sustain Damage” ability until it is repaired during the status phase or by another game effect.3387.4A unit can use its “Sustain Damage” ability any time a hit is produced against it. This includes hits produced during combat and from unit abilities such as the “Space Cannon” ability.aA unit can only use the “Sustain Damage” ability if it is eligible to be hit. For example, a player cannot use a dreadnought’s “Sustain Damage” ability to cancel a hit from “Anti-Fighter Barrage.”87.5The “Sustain Damage” ability cannot be used to cancel an effect that directly destroys a unit.87.6The Barony of Letnev’s “Non-Euclidean Shielding” faction technology allows the Letnev player’s units with the “Sustain Damage” ability to cancel up to two hits instead of one.RELATED TOPICS: Abilities, Ground Combat, Space Combat88SYSTEM TILESA system tile represents an area of the galaxy. Players place system tiles during setup to create the game board.88.1The back of each system tile is colored green, blue, or red.88.2System tiles with a green-colored back are home systems and faction-specific tiles. Each home system is unique to one of the game’s factions.88.3System tiles with a blue-colored back each contain one or more planets.88.4System tiles with a red-colored back are anomalies or are systems that do not contain planets.88.5Planets are located in systems. Ground forces and structures are usually placed on planets.88.6Any area on a system tile that is not a planet is space. Ships are usually placed in the space area.88.7Double-sided tiles that have lines crossing from one edge to another are hyperlane tiles. Hyperlane tiles are not systems.RELATED TOPICS:Adjacency, Anomalies, Planets, Ships, Wormholes89TACTICAL ACTIONThe tactical action is the primary method by which players produce units, move ships, and extend their dominion within the galaxy. To perform a tactical action, the active player performs the following steps:89.1STEP 1—ACTIVATION: The active player must activate a system that does not contain one of their command tokens.aTo activate a system, the active player places a command token from their tactic pool in that system. That system is the active system.bOther players’ command tokens do not prevent a player from activating a system.89.2STEP 2—MOVEMENT: The active player may move any number of ships that have a sufficient move value from any number of systems that do not contain one of their command tokens into the active system, following the rules for movement.aShips that have capacity values can transport ground forces and fighters when moving.bThe player may choose to not move any ships.cAfter the “Move Ships” step, all players can use the “Space Cannon” abilities of their units in the active system.89.3STEP 3—SPACE COMBAT: If two players have ships in the active system, those players must resolve a space combat.aIf the active player is the only player with ships in the system, they skip this step.89.4STEP 4—INVASION: The active player may use their “Bombardment” abilities, commit units to land on planets, and resolve ground combat against other players’ units.89.5STEP 5—PRODUCTION: The active player may resolve each of their unit’s “Production” abilities in the active system.aThe active player may do this even if they did not move units or land ground forces during this tactical action.RELATED TOPICS:Action Phase, Active System, Anti-Fighter Barrage, Bombardment, Command Sheet, Ground Combat, Invasion, Movement, Producing Units, Transport, Space Cannon, Space Combat90TECHNOLOGYTechnology cards allow players to upgrade units and acquire powerful abilities.90.1Each player places any technology they have gained faceup near their faction sheet. For the duration of the game, they own any technology cards they gain and can use the abilities on those cards.90.2A player does not own any technology card that is in their technology deck.90.3A player can gain a technology card from their technology deck by researching technology.aBoth the primary and secondary abilities of the “Technology” strategy card allow a player to research a technology.90.4Any technology card that a player has not gained remains in their technology deck. A player can look through their technology deck at any time.You may exhaust this card before 1 or  more of your units use SPACE CANNON;  hits produced by those units must be assigned to non-fighter ships if able.GRAVITON LASER SYSTEM3490.5If an ability instructs a player to gain a technology, they do not research it; they take it from their technology deck and place it in their play area, ignoring prerequisites.90.6Some technologies are unit upgrades. Unit upgrades share a name with a unit that is printed on a player’s faction sheet.aPlayers place any unit upgrades they gain faceup on their faction sheets, covering the unit that shares a name with that upgrade card.90.7Each technology that is not a unit upgrade has a colored symbol displayed in the lower-right corner of the card and on its card back that indicates that technology’s color.aA technology’s color has no inherent game effect; however, each technology a player owns can satisfy a prerequisite of a matching color when researching other technology.bUnit upgrades do not have a color and do not satisfy prerequisites.cThere are four colors of technologies as follows:90.8Most technology cards have a column of colored symbols displayed in the lower-left corner of the card. Each symbol in this column is a prerequisite.aA technology card’s prerequisites indicate the number and color of technologies a player must own to research that technology card.90.9RESEARCHING TECHNOLOGYA player can research technology by resolving either the primary or secondary ability of the “Technology” strategy card during the action phase. Other game effects may also instruct a player to research technology.90.10To research technology, a player gains that technology card from their technology deck and places it in their play area near their faction sheet.aPlayers place any unit upgrades they gain faceup on their faction sheets, covering the unit that shares a name with that upgrade card.90.11A player cannot research a faction technology that does not match their faction.BioticCyberneticPropulsionWarfare90.12When researching technology, a player must satisfy each of a technology’s prerequisites to research it. To satisfy a technology’s prerequisites, that player must own one technology of the matching color for each prerequisite symbol on the technology card they wish to research.aPrerequisites symbols are displayed as symbols on the lower-left corner of the card.bUnit upgrade technologies do not have a color and do not satisfy prerequisites.cPlayers may use certain abilities or technology specialties to ignore some prerequisites.90.13TECHNOLOGY SPECIALTIESA technology specialty is a technology symbol found on some planets.90.14When researching technology, a player can exhaust a planet they control that has a technology specialty to ignore one prerequisite symbol of the matching type on the technology card they are researching.90.15If the planet card is already exhausted, it cannot be used to ignore a prerequisite.90.16VALEFAR ASSIMILATORThe Nekro Virus faction can use its faction abilities in combination with its two “Valefar Assimilator” faction technologies to gain faction technologies that have been researched by other players, including unit upgrades.90.17Basic units printed on faction sheets are not technologies and are not eligible targets for “Valefar Assimilator.”90.18If a player becomes eliminated while one of their technologies has a Valefar Assimilator token on it, the Nekro Virus player places that technology in their play area; it is not removed from the game.90.19If a Valefar Assimilator token is removed from the Saar “Floating Factory” unit upgrade, each of the Nekro Virus’ space docks must be placed on an eligible planet they control in that space dock’s system, or the space dock is returned to their reinforcements.90.20If a Valefar Assimilator token is removed from a war sun unit upgrade and the Nekro Virus player does not have the standard war sun unit upgrade, each of the Nekro Virus player’s war suns are returned to their reinforcements.90.21The Nekro Virus player may upgrade their units with units of the same type (e.g., “dreadnought” or “infantry”) even if those unit’s names do not match. If the Nekro Virus gains a unit upgrade technology of the same unit type as a unit upgrade technology they already have, the previous upgrade is removed, and they must use the same Valefar Assimilator token that was used to copy the previous upgrade.3590.22When a Valefar Assimilator token is on a technology, that technology’s color and type count toward objectives.RELATED TOPICS:Command Tokens, Exhausted, Initiative Order, Resources, Strategic Action, Strategy Card, Technology (Strategy Card), Unit Upgrades91TECHNOLOGY (STRATEGY CARD)The “Technology” strategy card allows players to research new technology. This card’s initiative value is “7.”91.1During the action phase, if the active player has the “Technology” strategy card, they can perform a strategic action to resolve that card’s primary ability.91.2To resolve the primary ability on the “Technology” strategy card, the active player can research one technology of their choice. Then, they may research one additional technology of their choice by spending six resources.91.3After the active player resolves the primary ability of the “Technology” strategy card, each other player, beginning with the player to the left of the active player and proceeding clockwise, may research one technology of their choice by spending one command token from their strategy pool and four resources.RELATED TOPICS:Initiative Order, Resources, Strategic Action, Strategy Card, Technology92TRADE(STRATEGY CARD)The “Trade” strategy card allows players to gain trade goods and replenish commodities. This card’s initiative value is “5.” 92.1During the action phase, if the active player has the “Trade” strategy card, they can perform a strategic action to resolve that card’s primary ability. To resolve the primary ability on the “Trade” strategy card, the active player resolves the following effects in order:92.2STEP 1—The active player gains 3 trade goods.92.3STEP 2—The active player replenishes their commodities by taking the number of commodity tokens necessary to have an amount equal to the commodity value on their faction sheet. Then, they place those tokens in the commodity area of their faction sheet.aA player cannot have more commodities than the commodity value printed on their faction sheet.92.4STEP 3—The active player chooses any number of other players. Those players use the secondary ability of this card without spending a command token.aThe chosen players must resolve the secondary ability of this card without spending a command token after the active player finishes resolving the primary ability.bThe chosen players can only use the secondary ability once, and they cannot use it by spending command tokens.92.5After the active player resolves the primary ability of the “Trade” strategy card, each other player, beginning with the player to the left of the active player and proceeding clockwise, may spend one command token from their strategy pool to replenish their commodities.RELATED TOPICS:Command Tokens, Commodities, Initiative Order, Strategic Action, Strategy Card, Trade Goods93TRADE GOODSA trade good represents a player’s buying and trading power beyond their planet’s raw resources.93.1Trade goods and commodities are represented by opposite sides of the same token.93.2When a player gains a trade good, they take a trade good token from the supply and place it on the trade good area on their command sheet, making sure the trade good side is faceup.93.3A player can spend trade goods at any time during the game.93.4A player can spend a trade good in one of the following ways:aIn place of spending one resource.bIn place of spending one influence. However, trade goods cannot be spent to cast votes during the agenda phase.cTo resolve an effect that specifically requires that a trade good be spent.93.5A player can exchange their trade goods with other players during a transaction.93.6When a player receives a commodity token from another player, the player who received that token places it in their trade good area with the trade good side of the token faceup.aThat token is no longer a commodity token; it is a trade good token.93.7Trade good tokens come in values of one and three. A player can swap between these tokens as necessary.RELATED TOPICS:Commodities, Deals, Influence, Resources, Transactions94TRANSACTIONSA transaction is a way for a player to exchange commodities, trade goods, promissory notes, and relic fragments.94.1During the active player’s turn, they may resolve up to one transaction with each of their neighbors.aA player can resolve a transaction at any time during their turn, even during a combat.3696UNITSA unit is represented by a plastic figure.96.1There are three types of units: ships, ground forces, and structures.96.2Each color of plastic comes with the following units:•3 Space Docks•6 PDS units•8 Destroyers•8 Cruisers•2 War Suns•12 Infantry •10 Fighters•4 Carriers•5 Dreadnoughts•1 Flagship•4 Mechs96.3Units exist either on the game board or in a player’s reinforcements.RELATED TOPICS:Ground Forces, Ships, Structures97UNIT UPGRADESA unit upgrade is a type of technology card.97.1Unit upgrades share a name with a unit that is printed on a player’s faction sheet, but have a higher roman numeral. For example, a player’s “Carrier I” unit is upgraded by the unit upgrade technology “Carrier II.”aThe Nekro Virus player may upgrade their units with units of the same type (e.g., “dreadnought” or “infantry”) even if those unit’s names do not match. If the Nekro Virus gains a unit upgrade technology of the same unit type as a unit upgrade technology they already have, the previous upgrade is removed, and they must use the same Valefar Assimilator token that was used to copy the previous upgrade.97.2Players place unit upgrades they gain faceup on their faction sheets, covering the unit that shares a name with that upgrade card.97.3The white arrows next to an attribute on a faction sheet indicate that the attribute will improve when the unit is upgraded.97.4After a player gains a unit upgrade card, each of that player’s units that correspond to that upgrade card is treated as having the attributes and abilities printed on that upgrade card. Any previous attributes of that unit, such as the one printed on that player’s faction sheet, are ignored.97.5A mech unit card is not a technology.RELATED TOPICS:Technology94.2To resolve a transaction, a player gives any number of trade goods and commodities and up to one promissory note to a neighbor in exchange for any number of trade goods, commodities, and relic fragments, and up to one promissory note.94.3Players can exchange commodities, trade goods, promissory notes, and relic fragments, but cannot exchange other types of cards or tokens.aThe Emirates of Hacan can also exchange action cards with other players as part of their transactions.94.4A transaction does not have to be even.

A common way that a player can gain victory points is by scoring objectives.98.2Each player uses the victory point track to indicate the number of victory points they have gained.aIf the players are using the 14-space side of the victory point track, the game ends and a player wins when they have 14 victory points instead of 10.98.3Each player places one of their control tokens on space “0” of the victory point track during setup.98.4When a player gains a victory point, they advance their control token a number of spaces along the victory point track equal to the number of victory points gained.aA player’s control token must always be on the space of the victory point track that shows a number that matches the number of victory points that player has gained during the game. A player cannot have more than 10 victory points.98.5If an ability refers to the player with the “most” or “fewest” victory points, and more than one player is tied in that respect, the effect applies to all of the tied players.98.6If a player gains a victory point from a law, and that law is discarded, that player does not lose that victory point.98.7The game ends immediately when one player has 10 victory points. If multiple players would simultaneously gain their 10th victory point, the player who is earliest in initiative order among those players is the winner; if this occurs when players do not have strategy cards, the player who is nearest the speaker (including the speaker) in clockwise order is the winner.98.8If the game ends because the speaker cannot reveal an objective card, the player with the most victory points is the winner. If one or more players are tied for having the most victory points, the tied player who is first in initiative order is the winner.

follows: “After the speaker votes on an agenda: Spend any number of trade goods. For each trade good spent, cast 1 additional vote for the outcome on which you voted.”DEVOTIONThe text of the Yin Brotherhood’s “Devotion” faction ability should read as follows: “After each space battle round, you may destroy 1 of your cruisers or destroyers in the active system to produce 1 hit and assign it to 1 of your opponent’s ships in that system.”DIPLOMACYThe text of the “Diplomacy” strategy card’s primary ability should read as follows: “Choose 1 system other than the Mecatol Rex system that contains a planet you control; each other player places a command token from their reinforcements in that system. Then, ready up to 2 exhausted planets you control.”The text of the “Diplomacy” strategy card’s secondary ability should read as follows: “Spend 1 token from your strategy pool to ready up to 2 exhausted planets you control.”DIRECT HITThe text of the “Direct Hit” action card should read as follows: “After another player’s ship uses ‘Sustain Damage’ to cancel a hit produced by your units or abilities: Destroy that ship.”HARROWThe text of the L1Z1X’s “Harrow” faction ability should read as follows: “At the end of each round of ground combat, your ships in the active system may use their bombardment abilities against your opponent’s ground forces on the planet.”HEGEMONIC TRADE POLICYThe text of the Winnu faction technology “Hegemonic Trade Policy” should read as follows: “Exhaust this card when 1 or more of your units use ‘Production;’ swap the resource and influence values of 1 planet you control during that use of ‘Production.’”HYPER METABOLISMThe text of the “Hyper Metabolism” technology should read as follows: “During the status phase, gain 3 command tokens instead of 2.”MATRIARCHThe text of the Naalu flagship “Matriarch” should read as follows: “During an invasion in this system, you may commit fighters to planets as if they were ground forces. When combat ends, return those units to the space area.”POLITICAL FAVORThe text of the Xxcha promissory note “Political Favor” should read as follows: “When an agenda is revealed: Remove 1 token from the Xxcha player’s strategy pool and return it to their reinforcements. Then, discard the revealed agenda and reveal 1 agenda from the top of the deck. Players vote on this agenda instead. Then, return this card to the Xxcha player.”UNSTABLE PLANETThe text of the “Unstable Planet” action card should read as follows: “Action: Choose 1 hazardous planet. Exhaust that planet and destroy up to 3 infantry on it.”VETOThe text of the “Veto” action card should read as follows: “When an agenda is revealed: Discard that agenda and reveal 1 agenda from the top of the deck. Players vote on this agenda instead.”FAQThis section contains answers to frequently asked questions.GENERALQ: Are the “0” faces of the ten-sided dice included with the game intended to represent the result of a “10”?A: Yes, the “0” face is a “10” result.Q: How should a space combat be resolved if it is mathematically impossible for either side to win—for example, certain configurations of ships using the “Non-Euclidean Shielding” and “Duranium Armor” technologies in concert?A: If neither side has the potential to win, the attacker must retreat. If they cannot retreat, their units in the combat are destroyed.Q: Can fighters block ship movement?A: Yes, fighters can block ship movement (this was added as a correction in the Living Rules Reference version 1.1).Q: Does each unit participating in “Bombardment” or “Space Cannon” roll an additional die for the “Plasma Scoring” technology?A: No. “Plasma Scoring” only grants one additional die for each “Bombardment” or “Space Cannon” roll, and the unit benefiting from this technology must be decided before rolling.Q: Does “Planetary Shield” prevent the use of “X-89 Bacterial Weapon”?A: No. “X-89 Bacterial Weapon” is not part of bombardment, so it is not prevented by “Planetary Shield.”41Q: Can units be picked up and transported off of planets when using abilities that move ships, such as the “Skilled Retreat” action card or “Foresight” faction ability?A: Yes. Any effect that moves a ship allows that ship to transport units in its system, if it has available capacity.Q: Can you intentionally reveal hidden information to another player, such as an action card from your hand or your secret objective?A: Yes. This information is kept hidden by default, but it is permissible to reveal it to another player or players as a strategic option.Q: What happens to infantry that would be placed on a planet in any player’s home system by the effect of the “Infantry II” unit upgrade technology if that player does not own any planets in their home system?A: When those infantry would be placed on a home planet, they are returned to that player’s reinforcements instead.Q: Can a card (such as a promissory note) with a specified timing of a certain window that is acquired from a transaction during that window be played immediately?A: Yes. For example, a promissory note with “At the start of your turn:” timing may be immediately played if the transaction occurred within the “start of turn” timing window.Q: When the player resolving the “Trade” strategy card selects another player to resolve the “Trade” secondary ability for free, does the player resolving the effect for free do so during the execution of the primary ability or the secondary ability?A: They must resolve this effect during the resolution of the secondary ability as normal, but they do not have to spend a command token to do so.Q: If a player would refresh their commodities but already has the maximum amount, can another player still play that player’s “Trade Agreement” promissory note against them?A: Yes. Even if that player gains zero commodities when their commodities are refreshed, their “Trade Agreement” may still be played against them.Q: Does the “Neural Motivator” technology give an additional action card for both the standard status phase draw as well as the “Minister of Policy” agenda? What about the Yssaril’s “Scheming” faction ability?A: No. “Neural Motivator” gives only one action card in addition to the standard status phase draw. It is not triggered additional times by other abilities. The Yssaril’s “Scheming” ability, however, is triggered each time that action cards are drawn.Q: Does the “Political Secret” promissory note disable passive/mandatory faction abilities, such as the Barony of Letnev’s “Armada” faction ability, when it is used against that player?A: No. The “Political Secret” promissory note only prevents the use of faction abilities that a player must choose to use.Q: Does the “Political Secret” promissory note prevent a player from using faction-specific technology?A: No. The “Political Secret” promissory note does not prevent a player from using faction-specific technology, nor does it prevent the use of other abilities, such as those from agendas that a player might own.Q: Can the “Turn Their Fleets to Dust” objective be fulfilled by using a “Direct Hit” action card or by destroying a unit with capacity and allowing transported fighters to be removed as a result?A: No. In both situations, the “Space Cannon” ability did not destroy the last ship in the system, so the objective is not fulfilled.Q: If a player has multiple planets with PDS that are being invaded in a single system, does the “Plasma Scoring” technology add one die to each planet’s space cannon roll or for only one planet’s space cannon roll?A: The “Plasma Scoring” technology adds one die for each space planet’s “Space Cannon” roll.PRODUCTIONQ: When an ability other than “Production” allows you to produce one or more units, do you have to pay for the units produced?A: Yes, a unit that is produced must always be paid for.Q: When producing a unit with an ability other than “Production,” does the price reduction from the “Sarween Tools” technology apply?A: No, “Sarween Tools” is only used with the “Production” ability. AGENDASQ: When a “Research Team” agenda that is attached to a planet is used to ignore a prerequisite, is the planet exhausted?A: No. The agenda is exhausted, not the planet.Q: Can a player cast zero votes “For” or “Against” on an agenda instead of abstaining, in order to take advantage of effects associated with that option?A: No. A vote of zero is the same as abstaining; that player gains no positive or negative effects of voting “For” or “Against” on an agenda if they contributed zero votes.Q: Does the “Enforced Travel Ban” agenda prevent “Space Cannon” usage through wormholes?A: No. “Enforced Travel Ban” does not prevent “Space Cannon” usage.42ACTION CARDSQ: Is the “Skilled Retreat” action card considered to be a retreat, and can it be canceled by the action card “Intercept?”A: No, “Skilled Retreat” is not a retreat and cannot be canceled in this way.Q: Can “Sustain Damage” be used against the “Courageous to the End” action card?A: No, “Courageous to the End” does not produce hits.Q: Can two “Direct Hit” action cards be played by the same player during the same round of combat against different targets?A: Yes. Because the two “Direct Hit” cards are targeting different targets, this is allowed.Q: During space combat, can each player play a “Shields Holding” action card to cancel hits against their own units, even though the cards are being played during the same timing window?A: Yes. Because each of the “Shields Holding” cards are targeting different sets of hits (one set against player A and one set against player B), it is legal to play both cards.Q: Can the “Shields Holding” action card be used to cancel hits from abilities that occur during combat, such as “Ambush,” “Dimensional Splicer,” and “Devotion?”A: Yes. “Shields Holding” may be used to cancel hits that are produced by these abilities.Q: Can the “Direct Hit” action cards be played when a ship uses “Sustain Damage” to cancel a hit produced by one of your abilities?A: Yes. “Direct Hit” can be used to follow up hits that are assigned by “Ambush,” “Dimensional Splicer,” “Devotion,” and other similar abilities.Q: Does an effect that casts “additional votes,” such as the “Bribery” action card, create a timing window for playing the “Distinguished Councilor” action card?A: No. The “Distinguished Councilor” action card can only be played after you vote during the “Vote” step of resolving an agenda.Q: When during the action card playing process is a “Sabotage” card played?A: The “Sabotage” action can be played after card targets (such as units, planets, systems, cards, outcomes, or players) have been decided on, but must be played before any effects have been resolved, votes have been cast, or any dice have been rolled.Q: Can abilities that destroy units, such as the “Lucky Shot” action card, be used by a player against their own units or planets?A: No. “Lucky Shot” and other similar effects can only be used against other player’s units and planets.Q: If the “Classified Document Leaks” agenda is discarded, what happens?A: The secret objective remains in play; it is no longer a public objective and cannot by scored by any additional players, but it does not count toward the secret objective total of the player who originally owned it.Q: During a revote initiated by the “Miscount Disclosed” agenda, does the law that is being voted on remain active and in play?A: Yes, the law that is being voted on because of “Miscount Disclosed” remains in play during the revote.Q: If there is an ‘A’ wormhole on Mecatol Rex when the “Ixthian Artifact” agenda causes units in adjacent systems to be destroyed, does the Quantum Entanglement ability cause the Ghost of Creuss faction to lose units in a system that contains a ‘B’ wormhole?A: No. Only the Creuss treats those systems as adjacent.Q: When units are destroyed by the “Ixthian Artifact” agenda, in what order are they destroyed?A: Units destroyed by “Ixthian Artifact” are destroyed simultaneously.Q: If a player’s “Political Secret” promissory note is used against them, but that agenda is subsequently discarded by an effect such as the “Veto” action card, can that player vote and use faction abilities on the new agenda?A: Yes. It is a new agenda and thus the effect of the player’s “Political Secret” is ended.Q: Can the “Colonial Redistribution” agenda elect a planet that is already the target of “Demilitarized Zone,” and if so, can the chosen player place infantry to take control of the planet?A: Both agendas may target the same planet. However, in that situation, infantry cannot be placed on the elected planet, so it remains under the control of its original owner.Q: When the “Holy Planet of Ixth,” “Shard of the Throne,” or “The Crown of Emphidia” agendas are repealed, does the player who owns them lose a victory point?A: No, the player who gained a victory point from these agendas can only lose that point through the effect stated on the card. If the card is discarded in any other way, such as the “Repeal Law” action card, the point is not lost.Q: Is the trigger for the “Minister of War” agenda card’s ability “performing an action”?A: Yes. Performing any action is the trigger for the remainder of the “Minister of War” agenda card’s ability.43Q: Do infantry involved in a space combat due to the effects of “The Alastor” flagship count as ships for the purpose of card effects and fleet supply?A: Infantry that are participating in space combat due to the effects of “The Alastor” do count as ships (in addition to their own unit type) for the purpose of card effects. But, as a unit that can be transported, they do not count against fleet supply in that system.Q: Do infantry involved in a space combat due to the effects of “The Alastor” flagship cease participation in combat if the Alastor is destroyed?A: No. Infantry that are committed to the space combat due to the effects of “The Alastor” continue to participate until the end of the combat, even if “The Alastor” is destroyed.Q: Can the Nekro Virus have both a standard and a faction-specific unit upgrade of the same type?A: Yes. Only the faction-specific unit upgrade technology will be in effect, but should the Nekro lose the faction-specific upgrade technology that is being copied by the “Valefar Assimilator,” they would revert to the standard unit upgrade technology that was previously inactive.Q: If the Nekro Virus owns multiple unit upgrade technologies of the same type, such as “Dreadnought II” and “Exotrireme II,” does each one count toward the “Develop Weaponry” and “Revolutionize Warfare” objectives?A: No. Only one upgrade of a given type counts toward those objectives.Q: Do infantry involved in a space combat via the effects of “The Alastor” flagship count toward the ships required to use the “Assault Cannon” technology?A: Yes. These infantry may be used to resolve “Assault Cannon.”Q: Does the Winnu “Salai Sai Corian” flagship get additional dice for infantry participating in a fight due to the Nekro “Alastor” flagship?A: Yes. The “Salai Sai Corian” would get one additional die per infantry.THE EMIRATES OF HACANQ: Does the Hacan player have to initiate negotiations to perform a transaction with a player who is not their neighbor?A: As long as the active player is involved in the transaction, either player may suggest the opening of negotiations during either player’s turn.THE XXCHA KINGDOMQ: Can the Xxcha use the “Peace Accords” faction ability from one planet to another planet in the same system?A: Yes, a planet is treated as being adjacent to its own system.Q: Can multiple rider action cards be played by the same player on a single agenda?

The cruiser must already be in the activated system.Q: Can the “Experimental Battlestation” action card be used if no ships move into the active system, or against ships that do not belong to the active player?A: No. “Experimental Battlestation” operates in the same timing window as “Space Cannon Offense,” can only target the active player’s ships, and can only be resolved if ships actually move into the active system.Q: Can a player who cannot vote (such as the Nekro Virus) play rider action cards?A: Yes. The Nekro player, or a player who cannot vote due to another effect, can still play rider action cards.Q: If the speaker does not vote, can the “Bribery” action card still be played?A: Yes, even if the speaker cannot vote, or chooses not to vote, the “Bribery” action card (or any effect with the timing window of “after the speaker votes”) can still be played after the timing window in which the speaker would have cast votes. THE ARBORECQ: Can the secondary ability of the “Warfare” strategy card be used to trigger the “Production” ability of the Arborec’s Letani Warriors?A: No, the “Warfare” secondary ability can only be used to trigger the “Production” ability of space docks, and thus cannot be used by the Arborec to produce additional infantry.Q: Does the Arborec flagship (The “Duha Menaimon”) need to be in a system when it is activated to resolve its ability?A: Yes. The “Duha Menaimon” can only be used to produce units when it is in a system at the moment it is activated.Q: Can the “Production” abilities of multiple Arborec “Letani Warriors” in a system be combined to allow the production of two infantry for one resource? A: Yes. Production value is totaled when the “Production” ability of units in a system is used.THE NEKRO VIRUSQ: Can the Nekro Virus use the “Valefar Assimilator” technologies on printed faction units, such as the Embers of Muaat’s Prototype War Sun I?A: No, printed faction units are not technologies, and thus are ineligible targets for “Valefar Assimilator.”44THE MENTAK COALITIONQ: Can the Mentak Coalition use the “Salvage Operations” faction-specific technology to produce a war sun that was destroyed if they do not personally have war sun technology?A: No. Without war sun technology, they cannot produce a war sun, even using “Salvage Operations.”Q: Can the Mentak Coalition use the “Salvage Operations” faction-specific technology to produce their own flagship after destroying an opponent’s flagship?A: Yes, even though the units are technically different, they share the flagship unit type.Q: Can the Mentak Coalition use the “Salvage Operations” faction-specific technology to produce infantry after a combat against the Nekro Virus flagship “The Alastor” in which Nekro Virus infantry were treated like ships and were subsequently destroyed?A: No, the infantry do not count as ships once the combat is over.Q: Can the Mentak Coalition use the “Pillage” faction ability to steal trade goods when they are neighbors with another faction as a result of the “Lazax Gate Folding” faction technology or “Quantum Entanglement” faction ability?A: Yes, even in the case of “Quantum Entanglement” only being active from the Creuss’ point of view, because the ‘neighbor’ status is active as a result of the ability, the Mentak may use their “Pillage” in these situations.Q: Can the Mentak Coalition use the “Pillage” faction ability for each time the Saar gain a trade good from the “Scavenge” faction ability in a single turn, provided that the other requirements are met?A: Yes. The Mentak can trigger “Pillage” each time the Saar gain control of a planet, if all the conditions of “Pillage” are met.THE GHOSTS OF CREUSSQ: Can the Creuss Promissory note still be used if the Creuss have not researched “Wormhole Generator”?A: Yes, the promissory note does not require that the “Wormhole Generator” technology is researched.Q: Can the “Light/Wave Deflector” technology be used to move through a wormhole created by the Ghosts of Creuss’ “Hil Colish” flagship?A: Yes, “Light/Wave Deflector” allows a player other than the Ghosts of Creuss to move their fleet through the “Hil Colish’s” system into the Creuss home system or the Creuss Gate system.Q: If the “Hil Colish” moves before other ships and is returned to reinforcements by a gravity rift, can other ships still use its delta wormhole to reach the active system?A: No, the wormhole ceases to exist when the “Hil Colish” is returned to reinforcements.THE NAALU COLLECTIVEQ: Does “The Matriarch” flagship allow the Naalu to gain control of a planet using only fighters?A: No. The Naalu fighters return to the space area when ground combat ends. If no Naalu ground forces are present, the combat is considered to be a draw, and the Naalu do not gain control of the planet during the “Establish Control” step.Q: Using “The Matriarch” flagship in combination with the “Dacxive Animators” technology, can the Naalu gain control of a planet using only fighters?A: No. Because the combat ends in a draw, the “Dacxive Animators” ability is not triggered.Q: Does the Naalu “0” token move with the strategy card it is placed on if the card is exchanged with or taken by another player?A: No. The Naalu “0” token stays with the Naalu or the faction that gained the token through the “Gift of Prescience” promissory note and is placed on any of that player’s strategy cards.THE CLAN OF SAARQ: Can the Clan of Saar’s “Chaos Mapping” faction-specific technology be used at the start of each of that player’s turns during the action phase?A: Yes, “Chaos Mapping” can be used as many times as you have turns during the action phase.Q: Can the Clan of Saar’s “Chaos Mapping” faction-specific technology be used on the turn that the Saar player passes?A: Yes, “Chaos Mapping” can be used on the turn that a player passes.Q: Can the Clan of Saar’s “Floating Factories” trigger Space Cannon Offense or be assigned hits produced by PDS units?A: No, “Floating Factories” cannot be the target of PDS fire.
